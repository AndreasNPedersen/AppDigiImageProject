# WpfAppDigiProject
This is a small project that works locally (app and receiver have to be on the same machine / access to the same drive).
If this should be done right, I need to have another API project that takes the image (from local) to a specific storage(synchronized, it have to be waited on), where the receiver has access and can manipulate the image when it can.
